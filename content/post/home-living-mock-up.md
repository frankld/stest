### Tollenda est atque extrahenda radicitus

This is a personal project that I decided to do in between jobs to keep practicing and to stay on top of current trends. My goal is to create a mock up for a designer shop for different home products. 

I recently read up on atomic design and decided to try and split this project up into the different portions trying to stay in line with the atomic design way. 

I started this project of by designing a product component that would be utilized across the website. This component was my initial sketch for this product which later developed into a mini design system. I created a simple word mark for this brand then settled on a secondary typography to use on this project from google web fonts. I created a cool color pallets with muted colors. I really wanted to create clean and modern design that would really highlight the products. I decided to use a little bit of the atomic design process in order to organize this project. Break down the designs into smaller parts. The templates included with this project are a list page, a single page

### Color Palette

For this design I choose to use a muted color palette giving it more of an arts and crafts feel to it, I also choose to keep the colors on the cool side favoring blueish and blue greenish colors.
