### Production Designer

#### January 2019 to March 2019

I recently worked for Lorelli NYC from January to March of this year. Lorelli NYC caters to luxury property management firms offering branding and advertising. I gained a lot of experience as a production designer, working on a team under an account manager. My knowledge in the Adobe Creative suite came in handy while working with the Lorelli team. I utilized my skills in layout skills editing digital-ads, e-blasts, and mailers.
