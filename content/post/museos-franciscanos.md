I provided Los Museos Franciscanos in Bolivia with a modern rebrand of their brand family. We wanted to unify each museum under one brand, while also highlighting their own individual history. You can see the unity in the set of logos. Each logo consists of a shield that represents the three vows that the Franciscan take upon entering service: poverty, chastity, and obedience. At the same time, each logo contains details specific to their geographical location. For example, the logo belonging to Copacabana depicts the Virgen de Copacabana, which is a very important religious figure with a lot of followers in the area.
