During my time at WAM Partners I was able to work on a side project that involved the company. I was able to create a website using WordPress with a custom theme using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) in the back end, and then using Bootstrap for the front end.

#### Listings Website 

###### Problem

So the initial problem I had run into while working at WAM Partners was having to update their website. I had to juggle a lot of tasks being the Webmaster/Listings manager and having to update listings using HTML and CSS was not efficient. I initially suggest a redesign to the website to my boss and he was more than happy for me to pursue it as a side project. Later I came to realize that rather that it would be more useful to the company if I installed a CMS for them that they could use to manage the listings on their website.

###### Solution

Intellegi quidem, ut propter aliam quampiam rem, verbi gratia propter voluptatem, nos amemus; Itaque et manendi in vita et migrandi ratio omnis iis rebus, quas supra dixi, metienda. Aperiendum est igitur, quid sit voluptas; Cur ipse Pythagoras et Aegyptum lustravit et Persarum magos adiit? _Ratio enim nostra consentit, pugnat oratio._ Scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido patria esse cariorem. Tum Piso: Quoniam igitur aliquid omnes, quid Lucius noster? _Ostendit pedes et pectus._
