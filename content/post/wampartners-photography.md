### WAM Partners Photography

I updated the photography being used on the companyâ€™s website. Previously, they were using standard point and shoot images on their website with minimal editing. Therefore, I began to composite photos for each of the rental properties. I would execute this by setting up a tripod and taking various images at different exposures. Then, using Photoshop I would remove unwanted artifacts, fix lighting and correct color, which resulted in a high quality final composite that truly captured what the residences looked like in a quick turn-around time.
