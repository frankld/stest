    <p>My name is Francis and I am a Graphic Designer specializing in web design. I currently live in New York City after spending the last 9 years living La Paz, Bolivia, where I graduated from La Universidad Catolica with a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design.</p>

<p>In addition to web design, I also have a strong interest in branding, digital illustration and web development. When embarking on a new web project, I like to identify the main message or function that the website should fulfill in order to implement it in into the web design. My style is clean and minimal; however, I like to remain adaptable and learn new web design and user experience trends.</p>
