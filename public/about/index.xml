      <description>My name is Francis and I am a Graphic Designer specializing in web design. I currently live in New York City after spending the last 9 years living La Paz, Bolivia, where I graduated from La Universidad Catolica with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Graphic Design.
In addition to web design, I also have a strong interest in branding, digital illustration and web development. When embarking on a new web project, I like to identify the main message or function that the website should fulfill in order to implement it in into the web design.</description>
