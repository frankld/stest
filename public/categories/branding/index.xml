      <description>Tollenda est atque extrahenda radicitus This is a personal project I worked on in order to practice the open-composition design trend I recently read about on 99designs.com. My goal here was to create a mock-up for a home goods website. First, I sketched a product component to be used across the website. I then integrated the component into three different templates: a landing page, a product page and a shop page.</description>

      <description>I designed this courier logo first as a personal project. At first it was going to be a full fledged digital illustration, but after finishing the head I decided to create as a mock up logo.
Geometric, Clean and Minimal I decided to keep a clean minimal style for this project and based it all on basic shapes.
Vector Illustration in Adobe Illustrator I used adobe illustrator to create this logo, staring off with a circle, triangle and rectangle for the head, and a semi circle for the head.</description>

      <description>I provided Los Museos Franciscanos in Bolivia with a modern rebrand of their brand family. We wanted to unify each museum under one brand, while also highlighting their own individual history. You can see the unity in the set of logos. Each logo consists of a shield that represents the three vows that the Franciscan take upon entering service: poverty, chastity, and obedience. At the same time, each logo contains details specific to their geographical location.</description>
