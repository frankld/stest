      <description>This is a personal project I worked on in order to practice the open-composition design trend I recently read about on 99designs.com. My goal here was to create a mock-up for a home goods website. First, I sketched a product component to be used across the website. I then integrated the component into three different templates: a landing page, a product page and a shop page. I mocked-up a quick and simple word mark for the brand and picked a secondary typography from Google web fonts.</description>

      <description>WORDPRESS THEME During my time at WAM Partners I was able to work on a side project that involved the company. I was able to create a website using WordPress with a custom theme using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) in the back end, and then using Bootstrap for the front end.
So the initial problem I had run into while working at WAM Partners was having to update their website.</description>
